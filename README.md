## 📂 List of Programs
1. **Experiment 1:** Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .csv file.
2. **Experiment 2:** Implement and demonstrate the Candidate Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
3. **Experiment 3:** Demonstrate the working of the decision tree-based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
4. **Experiment 4:** Solve real-world problems using the following machine learning methods:  
   a) Linear Regression  
   b) Logistic Regression  
   c) Binary Classifier  
5. **Experiment 5:** Develop a program for Bias, Variance, Removing Duplicates, and Cross Validation.
6. **Experiment 6:** Implement Categorical Encoding and One-hot Encoding.
7. **Experiment 7:** Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test it using appropriate data sets.
8. **Experiment 8:** Implement the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the iris dataset. Print both correct and wrong predictions.
9. **Experiment 9:** Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm to fit data points. Select an appropriate dataset and draw graphs.
10. **Experiment 10:** Use the Naïve Bayesian Classifier model to classify a set of documents. Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall for your dataset. (Java/Python ML library classes/API can be used.)
11. **Experiment 11:** Apply the EM algorithm to cluster a Heart Disease Dataset. Use the same dataset for Clustering using the k-Means algorithm, compare the results, and comment on the quality of clustering. (Java/Python ML library classes/API can be used.)
12. **Experiment 12:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis for Classification using Pandas or Matplotlib.
